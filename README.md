Requirements:

- It should preferably be built with plain React.js, but you can use any JS framework, or none at all, Vanilla JS is just fine
- You can use any http request library for API communication
- It should have a kanban board with 3 lists: **Todo**, **Doing** and **Done**
- It should be possible to insert new tasks
- It should be possible to delete current tasks
- It should be possible to edit current tasks
- It should be possible to move tasks between lists
- It should not include any CSS framework
- The layout should be responsive to some degree, at least for mobile devices
